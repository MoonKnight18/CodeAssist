/**
 * Description of the modularity of a classpath.
 * <p>
 * A classpath is a list of JAR files, classes and resources folders passed to one of the JDK's commands like javac, java, or javadoc.
 * Since Java 9, these commands offer two different approaches to handle such a classpath:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>A traditional classpath by using the --classpath parameter.
 *   <li>A modular classpath (module path) using the --module-path parameter.
 * </ul>
 *
 * If the --module-path is used, the Java Platform Module System (JPMS) becomes active and the module descriptors (module-info.class)
 * files are used to limit visibility of packages between modules at compile and runtime.
 * <p>
 * Wherever a classpath (a list of files and folders) is configured in Gradle, it can be accompanied by a ModularClasspathHandling object
 * to describe how the entries of that list are to be passed to the --classpath and --module-path parameters.
 *
 * @since 6.4
