 * Details about an artifact selection in the context of a dependency substitution.

 * Artifact selections are handy as a migration path from the Maven or Ivy ecosystem,
 * where different "variants" are actually represented as different artifacts, with
 * specific (type, extension, classifier) sub-coordinates, in addition to the GAV
 * (group, artifact, version) coordinates.
 *
 * It is preferable to use component metadata rules to properly describe the variants
 * of a module, so this variant selector should only be used when defining such rules
 * is not possible or too complex for the use case.
