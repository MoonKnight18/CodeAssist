 * A listener that is notified as build operations are executed.

 * Unlike ListenerManager bound listeners, build operation listener signalling is not synchronized.
 * Implementations must take care to be threadsafe.
 *
 * Related signals are guaranteed to be serialized.
 * That is, a listener will not concurrently be notified of the same operation starting and finishing.
