 * Manages listeners of build operations.

 * There is one global listener for the life of the build runtime.
 * Listeners must be sure to remove themselves if they want to only listen for a single build.
 *
 * Listeners are notified in registration order.
 * Started and progress notifications are emitted in registration order,
 * while finished notifications are emitted in reverse registration order.
 *
 * Listeners will not receive progress notifications for events before they have received
 * the corresponding start notification or after they have received the corresponding finished notification.
 * Such notifications are just discarded for the listener.
