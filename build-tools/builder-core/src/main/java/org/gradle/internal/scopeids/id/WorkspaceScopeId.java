/**
 * The persistent ID of a potential build on disk.
 *
 * It is effectively the root dir of a build.
 * That is, two builds with the same root dir share the same workspace.
 *
 * In practice, this generally maps to what users would think of as “checkout” of a project.
 * Builds of the same checkout over time will share the same workspace ID.
 *
 * This ID is persisted in the root build's project cache dir.
 * If this cache directory is destroyed, a new ID will be issued.
