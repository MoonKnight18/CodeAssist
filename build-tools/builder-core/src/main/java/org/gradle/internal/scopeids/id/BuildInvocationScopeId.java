 * The ID of a single build invocation.

 * For example, buildSrc shares the same build scope ID as the overall build.
 * All composite participants also share the same build scope ID.
 * That is, all “nested” builds (in terms of GradleLauncher etc.) share the same build ID.
 *
 * This ID is, by definition, not persistent.
