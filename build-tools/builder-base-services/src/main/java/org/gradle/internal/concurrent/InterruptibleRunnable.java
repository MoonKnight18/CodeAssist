 * Wraps a runnable so that it can be interrupted. Useful when {@link java.util.concurrent.Future} is not available or its behavior is not desired.
 *
 * In contrast to {@link java.util.concurrent.Future#cancel(boolean)}, the delegate Runnable is always called, even if an interrupt was received before this runnable was started.
 * This can be used to implement guaranteed delivery mechanisms, where proper interrupt handling is up to the delegate.
