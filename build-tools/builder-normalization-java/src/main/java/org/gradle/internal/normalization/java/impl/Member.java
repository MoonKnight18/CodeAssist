/**
 * Models a single element of a codebase that may be inspected and acted upon with
 * bytecode manipulation libraries tools like ASM.
 *
 * <p>The notion of "member" here is similar to, but broader than
 * {@link java.lang.reflect.Member}. The latter is essentially an abstraction over fields,
 * methods and constructors; this Member and its subtypes represent not only fields and
 * methods, but also classes, inner classes, annotations and their values, and more. This
 * model is minimalistic and has a few assumptions about being used in an ASM context, but
 * provides us in any case with what we need to effectively find and manipulate API
 * members and construct API classes out of them.
